            A Formula One car or F1 car is a single-seat, open-cockpit,
            open-wheel formula racing car used to compete in Formula One racing events.
            It has substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged
            engine positioned behind the driver. The cars are constructed of carbon fibre
            and other composite materials for durability and are built to withstand
            high impact forces and considerable g forces.

            The modern Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel racing car with
            substantial front and rear wings, large wheels, and a turbocharged engine positioned behind
            the driver. The monocoque is constructed of reinforced carbon fiber, lined with kevlar and fire
            resistant materials to protect the driver from high impact crashes and fires. The driver cockpit
            consists of single seat with a detachable steering wheel in the front. A halo safety device mounted
            on top of the open cockpit was introduced in 2018. Two front and rear wheels are bolted to the
            suspension and the engine is mounted behind the driver.

            The early F1 cars were simpler designs with no wings, front mounted engines, and required significant driver
            effort to control. In the early 1960s, lighter cars with aluminum chassis were introduced with the addition
            of wings towards the end of the same decade...
